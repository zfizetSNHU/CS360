Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The goal of the mobile application was to create a simple, easy to use weight tracking app that allowed users to track their weight change
over time. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The app was designed with simplicity in mind, meaning that the app would really only require one screen with 2 or so "pop-ups" that
allowed users to make the necessary changes that they needed. The design of the UI was meant to be user-centered because it was simple.
Many other apps that track weight have a lot of extra "fluff" that some users may find confusing or may not want. My goal was to create
an application that ONLY concerned itself with tracking weight. The UI was designed to reflect that. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

I was not able to complete the app, thus leaving the coding part empty as of now. I hope to finish the app in the future.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

The testing phase of coding is important because it will literally show you if you have a functional app or not. For android studio,
you're able to emulate a phone directly within the application, allowing for you to test your app as if you were using it on a phone.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

The inital phase of designing the app, I think, was where my best innovation was. I "drew" the application using Lucidchart which allowed
me to "visualize" what I wanted the app to look like and function. In my discussion, I compared it to creating a storyboard, and I feel that
getting the initial design of the application visualized is half of the battle of creating an app.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I think just creating the initial design of the app allowed me to demonstrate my knowlege and skills working with a new piece of software.
I had never used android studio before and didn't know you could basically create an app by simply dragging and dropping certain things
into a layout and create an application much like how you would create a powerpoint. I am frustrated that I was not able to actually write
the code for the application, but I would like to finish it in the future.
